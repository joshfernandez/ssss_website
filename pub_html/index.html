                Hey everyone! It is a pleasure to be elected president for the Software Systems Student Society and be tasked with representing all of you!

                <p>
                My goal for this student society during my term is to:
                </p>

                <ol>

                  <li>
                    Strengthen our relations with the other pre-existing DSUs within the Faculty of Applied Sciences,
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Display a stronger presence of Software Systems and the student society at the Surrey Campus,
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Make a clear distinction between Computing Science and Software Systems, and ensure that students are enrolled in the right program, and
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Bring fun and educational events for our Software Systems students and make sure their concerns are swiftly addressed.
                  </li>

                </ol>

                <p>
                  If I'm not doing any volunteering work, you can find me either at the Fleetwood Recreational Centre or the SFU Burnaby gym! I also like to party and have a good time with friends when I'm not busy.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I hope that I can be a great president for you all. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact me either through email, Facebook, or just along the hallways at SFU!

                  I am a fourth-year SOSY and Innovation and Entrepreneurship student that has been involved in the SSSS since May 2016. I am grateful for the event-planning and networking opportunities SSSS presents, allowing us to introduce new events such as Systems Hacks last year where we created and showcased our ideas on lifestyle improvements through programming.
                </p>

                <p>
                  On a different note, some of my hobbies outside of school consist of web-developing, running and travelling.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I look forward to working with the 2017 SSSS Executive team and planning Systems Hacks 2018!

                  Hello World! I'm a third year Software Systems student here at SFU. I'm passionate about promoting diversity within the software engineering field, whether it's by example, or raising awareness.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As your SSSS Treasurer, I'll be doing a lot of the behind-the-scenes work. Together with my excellent team, I hope we can bring you all fun events that help put SOSY out there. I plan on making this a fun and eventful year for SOSY, so stay tuned!
                </p>

                <p>
                  I enjoy listening to music, going to the movies, and baking. You can find me on the Surrey campus pretty much week-round, so say hi!

                  Hey, SOSY! My name is Andy Wu, and I’m your Director of Activities for the SSSS. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  My goal is to create events that are catered to your interests and enjoyment. I’m a generally chill guy who enjoys dank memes and gaming. Hobbies of mine are writing poetry, figuring out puzzle solving problems, and not dying before finals.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Sometimes I get stuck in the matrix. If your name is Neo by any chance, I’m sure you can save me from Linear Algebra.
                </p> 

                <p>
                  Look forward to meeting you!

                  Hey, SOSY friends! I’m Josh, and I am your director for marketing and resources. It’s nice to meet you!
                </p>

                <p>
                  I am honoured and privileged to be leading and serving the Software Systems Student Society because of the events I host and the connections I make with other SOSY friends like you! Whether you are competing in hackathons, playing dodgeball at frosh, or taking advantage of the free pizza and pop at Board Games Night every month, I can guarantee you’ll have lots of fun because I myself have fun organizing those with the rest of the SSSS leaders.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I also sing, play guitar, or listen to music during my study breaks. I compete in hackathons so I can spend time coding and laughing at compile-time errors with my friends. I also own a pair of Nike Roshes and Nike Frees because they look awesome!
                </p>

                <p>
                  Software Systems is my program because of my interest in bioinformatics and front-end development. Other than that, I love those CMPT courses where team collaboration is involved because I get to make new friends. (I’m sure you’ll do, too!)

                  Hi everyone! My name is Chester Cervantes and I am the third-Year Representative for the SSSS. Over my years at SFU Software Systems, I have made improved my knowledge, made new friends, and created amazing memories. To return the favor, I will make sure that our student society will be looked after and maintained.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Outside of computing related activities, I play musical instruments, love volleyball, and enjoy playing League of Legends as a Diamond player. Feel free to come to talk me about anything as I am open to everything.

                  I’m your second year representative. I’m here to represent your problems to the Student society. If you see me around say hi, let me know what you think of The SSSS and what you would like to see us do. I love to hear from you all and gripe about midterms. Next time you see me say hi. I love using Java, not Javascript, to make small games. My favorite project was making a text-based adventure game,  but I hope to soon have a real one, it will be pathetic I’m sure, but that’s part of learning. I am also an aspiring writer. Say hi if you see me.

                Bonsoir friends. My name is Isha Jandu and I am really excited to meet you though this computer screen! *virtual hug* So, I’ve heard that I’m the treasure of the SSSS.. but they keep misspelling it using an ‘r’ at the end. Really have to get that fixed. All jokes aside, my job is to basically oversee the financial administration which is a fancy way of saying I deal with the money. I am really grateful for this opportunity and I will do my best to make you all proud!
              </p>
              <p>
                A little bit about me: I love meeting new people and picking their brains. I also love food, napping, and music. In my spare time, meaning when I’m not at school or work, you can probably find me at the gym or pool!
              </p>
              <p>
                P.S. I would love to be your friend if you let me pet your dog.

                Hello, I am the fifth year representative for the Software System Student Society. I originally began my degree as a Computer Science major, switching over to Software Systems (as it clearly was the better program). My experience over the years at SFU, such as attending to different types classes on different campus and having multiple co-op terms gives me a vast amount of experience. Any text in parenthesis I did not say out loud and will deny it if questioned about it.

                Hi everyone! My name is Tina, and I’m the Fourth Year Representative for the Software Systems Student Society. I’m currently on co-op, but I hope to make it to events and help out as needed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Having held various student leadership positions and work positions, I have developed a passion for community engagement and leading teams. In the past, I served as the Co-President for SFU Women in Computing Science, Co-Chair for the Try/CATCH 2015 Committee, Committee Member for the Systems Frosh Committee, and Secretary for the Software Systems Student Society. Lastly, I have served as a Committee Member for the Charity Cafe Committee at my previous co-op at RBC.
              </p>
              <p>
                My interests include bioinformatics, project management, and technology. In my spare time, I enjoy trying new cafes and brunch spots, hiking, and reading.
              </p>
